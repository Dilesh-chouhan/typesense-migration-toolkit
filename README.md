## üöÄ Quick Migration Guide

### Step 1: Export Schema from Typesense Cloud
1. Log in to your Typesense Cloud dashboard
2. Go to your collection
3. Click on "Export Schema" button
4. Save the schema file (it will be a JSON file)

### Step 2: Download Data from Source
```bash
./download_typesense_data.sh -k YOUR_API_KEY -h YOUR_HOST -c YOUR_COLLECTION
```
This will create a backup file in `.jsonl` format.

### Step 3: Import/Upload Data to Destination
```bash
./migrate_final_upload.sh
```

## üìã Prerequisites

- Access to Typesense Cloud dashboard
- Source Typesense instance (where your data is currently)
- Destination Typesense instance (where you want to copy data to)
- API keys for both instances
- Basic command line knowledge

## üîß Step-by-Step Guide with Examples

### 1. Get Schema from Typesense Cloud
- Log in to [Typesense Cloud](https://cloud.typesense.org)
- Navigate to your collection
- Click "Export Schema" and save the JSON file
- Keep this file safe - you'll need it for the import

### 2. Download Data from Cloud
```bash
# Example: Download from Typesense Cloud
./download_typesense_data.sh -k abc123 -h api.typesense.org -c products
```
This will generate a `.jsonl` file containing your collection data.

### 3. Import to Docker Instance
```bash
# Set your Docker instance details
export TYPESENSE_API_KEY="your_docker_api_key"
export TYPESENSE_HOST="http://localhost:8108"
export COLLECTION_NAME="products"
export SCHEMA_FILE="schema.json"  # The schema file you downloaded from Typesense Cloud

# Run the import script
./migrate_final_upload.sh
```

### üìù Real-World Example
Here's a complete example of migrating a collection named "products":

1. **Export Schema:**
   - Log in to Typesense Cloud
   - Go to "products" collection
   - Export and save as `products-schema.json`

2. **Download Data:**
```bash
./download_typesense_data.sh -k cloud_key -h api.typesense.org -c products
```
This creates `products.jsonl`

3. **Import to Docker:**
```bash
export TYPESENSE_API_KEY="docker_key"
export TYPESENSE_HOST="http://localhost:8108"
export COLLECTION_NAME="products"
export SCHEMA_FILE="products-schema.json"
./migrate_final_upload.sh
```

That's it! Your data is now copied to the new location. üéâ

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

1. Don't forget to export the schema from Typesense Cloud first!
2. This is a COPY operation - your original data remains intact
3. Make sure you have enough space for the backup file
4. Check your network connection
5. Verify your API keys work
6. The process might take some time depending on your data size
7. Data is exported in `.jsonl` format (JSON Lines) for efficient processing
